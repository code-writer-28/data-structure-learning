Order of Growth :- 
Points to Remember :- 
1. Order of Growth always measure where value -> infinite.(large input size)

2. On comparing any functions, if one of the function taking more time than other, than more time taken function created with bad algorithm. that is called measuring of order of growth.
    f(n) = n^2 + n + 6
    g(n) = 2n + 5, where lim ->  infinite.
    
    for measuring purpose :-
    lim(n) ->  infinite g(n) / f(n) = 0;
    
    Measurement :- 
    1. Always taking highest ordering term from both the functions and divide both denominator and numerator by that term here highest order term is n^2;
    
Direct way to find out the order of growth :- 
1. Ignore lower order terms.

2. Ignore Leading Constants.

const < loglogn < logn < n ^ 1/3 < n ^ 1/2 < n < n ^ 2 < n ^ 3 < n ^ 4 < 2 ^ n < n ^ n.
