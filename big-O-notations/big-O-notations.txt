Big O  Notaion :- 

Direct Way to find :-

1. Ignore the Lower Order Term.

2. Ignore leading constants.

for ex :- f(n) = 3n^2 + logn + const.
so Big O Notation for f(n) is, 
f(n) = O(n^2).


Definition :-
if f(n) = O(g(n)), if there exist constants c and m such that f(n) <= c * g(n) for all n >= m.

Let's say :- 
f(n) = 2n + 3 so f(n) = O(n)
now,
  f(n) <= c * g(n)
  2n + 3 <= c * n
then, 
  took c  as leading constant term + 1 which is 2 and add 1 in it so c = 3.
  2n+3 <= 3n
  so value represents the upper bound.
